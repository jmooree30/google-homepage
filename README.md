![Image Hover Text](/screenshot2.png)

This is my first HTML/CSS project re-creating Google's homepage.

If you're interested in doing this yourself check this out...

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

#update
Leaving project as is and considering it finished. Would like to use someday as a reminder of where I started.
